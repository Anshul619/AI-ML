# Foundational Models
- A foundational model is a large-scale, pre-trained AI model trained on broad and diverse data (e.g. text, images, code).

| Pre-training       | During the training stage, FMs use self-supervised learning or reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF), to capture data from vast datasets.                                                         |                                                                                      |
| Fine-tuning        | [Fine tuning](https://medium.com/@garethcull/fine-tuning-ai-models-a-practical-guide-for-beginners-dc313b2e0f76) is a technique used to improve the performance of a pre-trained AI model on a specific task. |                                                                                      |
| Prompt Engineering | [Prompt engineering](../PromptEngineering/Readme.md) is a more efficient way to tune LLM responses, as opposed to fine-tuning, which requires labeled data and training infrastructure.                       |

| Text-to-text models  | Text-to-text models are large language models (LLMs) that are pretrained to process vast quantities of textual data and human language. |
| Text-to-image models | Text-to-image models take natural language input and produce a high-quality image that matches the input text description.              |
