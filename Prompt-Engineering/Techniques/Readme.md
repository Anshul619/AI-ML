| Zero-shot prompting        | [Zero-shot prompting](ZeroShotPrompting.md) is a technique where a user presents a task to a generative/LLM model without providing any examples or explicit training for that specific task.  |
| Few-shot prompting         | [Few-shot prompting](FewShotPrompting.md) is a technique that involves providing a language model with contextual examples to guide its understanding and expected output for a specific task. |
| Chain-of-thought prompting | [Chain-of-thought (CoT) prompting](ChainOfThoughtPrompting.md) is a technique that divides intricate reasoning tasks into smaller, intermediary steps.                                         |
