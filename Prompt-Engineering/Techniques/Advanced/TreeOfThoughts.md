# Tree of Thoughts
- [Tree of thoughts (ToT)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.10601) is another technique that builds on the CoT prompting technique. 
- CoT prompting samples thoughts sequentially, but ToT prompting follows a tree-branching technique. 
- With the ToT technique, the LLM can learn in a nuanced way, considering multiple paths instead of one sequential path.
