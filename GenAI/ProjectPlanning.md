| Define the scope | This step helps to ensure that the AI project is focused, relevant, and achievable.<br/>- Analyse long-term and short-term impacts.<br/>-Ideally, implement both solutions (easy & robust) in parallel. Get the quick win with copilots so your developers benefit from time savings right away. <br/>- Meanwhile, your ML team designs a solution that uses generative AI to improve the customer experience. |
| Select a model   | Using a pre-trained model as is provides a quick solution for integrating generative AI capabilities.<br/>- Fine-tuning a pre-existing model for more customized output offers the flexibility to tailor the model to your specific needs.                                                                                                                                                                     |
| Adapt model      | Prompt engineering is the process of designing and refining your prompts or inputs in order for the model to generate specific types of outputs that suit your needs<br/>- Fine-tuning is a continuation of pre-training that creates a new specialized model and requires high-quality, labeled data.                                                                                                         |
| Use the model    | The chatbot solution is complete. To recap, it uses a pretrained model that was fed contextual information and prompt engineering to increase the quality of the output.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |
