| Be Clear and concise                             | Prompts should be straightforward and avoid ambiguity.<br/>- Clear prompts lead to more coherent responses. <br/>- Craft prompts with natural, flowing language and coherent sentence structure. <br/>- Avoid isolated keywords and phrases.                                        | Compute the sum total of the subsequent sequence of numerals: 4, 8, 12, 16. | What is the sum of these numbers: 4, 8, 12, 16?                                                              |
| Include context if needed                        | Provide any additional context that would help the model respond accurately.                                                                                                                                                                                                        | Summarize this article: [insert article text]                               | Provide a summary of this article to be used in a blog post: [insert article text]                           |
| Use directives for the appropriate response type | If you want a particular output form, such as a summary, question, or poem, specify the response type directly. <br/>- You can also limit responses by length, format, included information, excluded information, and more.                                                        | What is the capital?                                                        | What is the capital of New York? Provide the answer in a full sentence.                                      |
| Consider the output in the prompt                | Mention the requested output at the end of the prompt to keep the model focused on appropriate content.                                                                                                                                                                             | Calculate the area of a circle.                                             | Calculate the area of a circle with a radius of 3 inches (7.5 cm). Round your answer to the nearest integer. |
| Start prompts with an interrogation              | Phrase your input as a question, beginning with words, such as who, what, where, when, why, and how.                                                                                                                                                                                | Summarize this event.                                                       | Why did this event happen? Explain in three sentences.                                                       |
| Provide an example response                      | Use the expected output format as an example response in the prompt. <br/>- Surround it in brackets to make it clear that it is an example.                                                                                                                                         | Determine the sentiment of this social media post: [insert post]            | Determine the sentiment of the following social media post using these examples:                             |
| Break up complex tasks                           | Foundation models can get confused when asked to perform complex tasks.                                                                                                                                                                                                             |                                                                             |                                                                                                              |
| Experiment & be creative                         | Try different prompts to optimize the model's responses. <br/>- Determine which prompts achieve effective results and which prompts achieve inaccurate results. <br/>- Adjust your prompts accordingly. <br/>- Novel and thought-provoking prompts can lead to innovative outcomes. |                                                                             |                                                                                                              |
| Use Prompt templates                             | Prompt templates are predefined structures or formats that can be used to provide consistent inputs to FMs.<br/>- They help ensure that the prompts are phrased in a way that is easily understood by the model and can lead to more reliable and higher-quality outputs.                                                                                                                                                                  |                                                                             |                                                                                                              |
