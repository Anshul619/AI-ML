| Zero-shot prompting        | Zero-shot prompting is a technique where a user presents a task to a generative model without providing any examples or explicit training for that specific task.       |
| Few-shot prompting         | Few-shot prompting is a technique that involves providing a language model with contextual examples to guide its understanding and expected output for a specific task. |
| Chain-of-thought prompting | Chain-of-thought (CoT) prompting is a technique that divides intricate reasoning tasks into smaller, intermediary steps.                                                |
