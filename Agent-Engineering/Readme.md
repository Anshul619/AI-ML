# Agentic AI
- Agentic AI refers to artificial intelligence systems that can autonomously plan, make decisions, and take actions to achieve specific goals without needing constant human input. 
- These systems operate with a degree of initiative, like software agents that pursue objectives across multiple steps or tasks.

# Steps
- Take a high-level goal (e.g. **Create a business plan for a new AI startup**).
- Break it down into sub-tasks.
- Search the web, gather data, write documents, or interact with files or APIs.
- Make decisions and iterate until the goal is completed (or it runs into limits).

# Use Case Example

## High Level Goal 
- Find profitable products to sell online in 2025 and create a market report.

## Steps
- Search online trends and marketplaces.
- Compile data.
- Analyze competitors and pricing.
- Draft a report â€” all autonomously, deciding how to proceed at each step.

# Tips for Better Results
- Use clear, detailed prompts.
- Include requirements like: **tech stack**, **features**, **performance goals** etc.
- Iterate: **tweak your prompt** or **modify generated files** to improve.
