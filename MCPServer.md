# MCP Server
- Model Context Protocol (MCP) is an open standard—like a universal interface—that enables large language models (LLMs) to access tools, data, or external services through a standardized protocol. 
- It solves the problem of having to build bespoke integrations for each LLM-tool pair, simplifying the “N×M” integration challenge. and supports transports like stdio (local) and HTTP or HTTP+SSE (remote) using JSON-RPC under the hood
